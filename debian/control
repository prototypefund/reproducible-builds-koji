 software.
 .
 Key features:
 .
  -  New buildroot for each build
  -  Robust XML-RPC APIs for easy integration with other tools
  -  Web interface with SSL and Kerberos authentication
  -  Thin, portable command line client

  - koji-web is a set of scripts that run in mod_wsgi and use the Cheetah
    templating engine to provide a web interface to Koji.
  - kojira is a daemon that keeps the build root repodata updated.
